# Bookify
## Alura - ONE Oracle Next Education T6

## Presentation

**Bookify** is an application developed as part of the Java course offered by Alura, in collaboration with Oracle ONE. This project harnesses the power of the Gutendex API to access its extensive catalog of books, providing a vast online library of free e-books. With Bookify, users can search and locate books from Project Gutenberg, interact directly through the terminal, and store book and author information in a local database. To build the book catalog, we interact with the Gutendex API and save the book and author information in a PostgreSQL database.
